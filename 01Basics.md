# Basics

## Print Function

**print() function** - outputs what is within the parentheses to the console

## String

**String** is a sequence of characters


## Variables

**Variables** - are containers for data. The first character of your variable name cannot be a digit.Variables are equivalent to a certain value, which can be a string or a number. There are used to save values into memory using a name that we assign.

**Value** - can be anything from a string to the number

**String concatenation** - is when strings are added using the addition symbol 

**Example:**
"Ducks" + "Chicks"

## Syntax and Errors

**Block of code** - refers to code that belongs to the same line, and are indented

**Comments** - are completely ignored and it can be written using hash characther(#). 

**Indentations** - is extremely important because we use them to create a new block of code. Indented blocks are also preceded by a colon on the previous line.

**Parentheses** - is the print() function indicate that we need to put something within them. They can also be used in mathematical operations.

**Errors** - result from Python rules not being followed in our code.
